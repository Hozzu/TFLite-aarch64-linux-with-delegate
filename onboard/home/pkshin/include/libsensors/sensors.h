 * Sensor type
 *
 * Each sensor has a type which defines what this sensor measures and how
 * measures are reported. See the Base sensors and Composite sensors lists
 * for complete descriptions:
 * http://source.android.com/devices/sensors/base_triggers.html
 * http://source.android.com/devices/sensors/composite_sensors.html
 *
 * Device manufacturers (OEMs) can define their own sensor types, for
 * their private use by applications or services provided by them. Such
 * sensor types are specific to an OEM and can't be exposed in the SDK.
 * These types must start at SENSOR_TYPE_DEVICE_PRIVATE_BASE.
 *
 * All sensors defined outside of the device private range must correspond to
 * a type defined in this file, and must satisfy the characteristics listed in
 * the description of the sensor type.
 *
 * Starting with version SENSORS_DEVICE_API_VERSION_1_2, each sensor also
 * has a stringType.
 *  - StringType of sensors inside of the device private range MUST be prefixed
 *    by the sensor provider's or OEM reverse domain name. In particular, they
 *    cannot use the "android.sensor" prefix.
 *  - StringType of sensors outside of the device private range MUST correspond
 *    to the one defined in this file (starting with "android.sensor").
 *    For example, accelerometers must have
 *      type=SENSOR_TYPE_ACCELEROMETER and
 *      stringType=SENSOR_STRING_TYPE_ACCELEROMETER
 *
 * When android introduces a new sensor type that can replace an OEM-defined
 * sensor type, the OEM must use the official sensor type and stringType on
 * versions of the HAL that support this new official sensor type.
 *
 * Example (made up): Suppose Google's Glass team wants to surface a sensor
 * detecting that Glass is on a head.
 *  - Such a sensor is not officially supported in android KitKat
 *  - Glass devices launching on KitKat can implement a sensor with
 *    type = 0x10001 and stringType = "com.google.glass.onheaddetector"
 *  - In L android release, if android decides to define
 *    SENSOR_TYPE_ON_HEAD_DETECTOR and STRING_SENSOR_TYPE_ON_HEAD_DETECTOR,
 *    those types should replace the Glass-team-specific types in all future
 *    launches.
 *  - When launching Glass on the L release, Google should now use the official
 *    type (SENSOR_TYPE_ON_HEAD_DETECTOR) and stringType.
 *  - This way, all applications can now use this sensor.

  * Wake up sensors.
  * Each sensor may have either or both a wake-up and a non-wake variant.
  * When registered in batch mode, wake-up sensors will wake up the AP when
  * their FIFOs are full or when the batch timeout expires. A separate FIFO has
  * to be maintained for wake up sensors and non wake up sensors. The non wake-up
  * sensors need to overwrite their FIFOs when they are full till the AP wakes up
  * and the wake-up sensors will wake-up the AP when their FIFOs are full or when
  * the batch timeout expires without losing events. Wake-up and non wake-up variants
  * of each sensor can be activated at different rates independently of each other.

  * Note: Proximity sensor and significant motion sensor which were defined in previous
  * releases are also wake-up sensors and should be treated as such. Wake-up one-shot
  * sensors like SIGNIFICANT_MOTION cannot be batched, hence the text about batch above
